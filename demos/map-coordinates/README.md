# Map Coordinates Â· Shared Arena

A lightweight multiplayer sketch that uses the local MoQ relay to fan out player locations. Open multiple browser tabs to see avatars move across the same grid.

## Controls & Flow

- The page auto-connects to the local MoQ relay and then waits for a Nostr login.
- Use a NIP-07 signer (Alby, Damus, etc.) and click **Login with Nostr** to join the arena.
- Move with WASD or arrow keys once logged in.
- Adjust the relay endpoint by setting `VITE_RELAY_URL` (defaults to `http://localhost:4443/anon`).

## Recipes

```bash
# Install dependencies
just -f demo/demos/map-coordinates/Justfile install

# Launch the dev server (same as `just -f demo/Justfile map-coordinates`)
just -f demo/demos/map-coordinates/Justfile demo

# Build a production bundle
just -f demo/demos/map-coordinates/Justfile build
```

By default the dev server runs on http://localhost:5175 and will watch the neighboring `moq` source because Vite aliases those TypeScript files directly. Any changes in `moq/js/moq` or `moq/js/signals` will hot-reload into the demo, which keeps experiments close to the in-repo code.
